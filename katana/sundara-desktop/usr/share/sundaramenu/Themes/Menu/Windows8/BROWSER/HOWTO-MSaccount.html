However, I'm sure there are some Linux users who would like to use Microsoft Office apps (Office, Excel, Powerpoint) if available for Linux.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Good news! Did you know there's a version of MS Office that works natively in Linux? What's more, there's no need to use the Wine emulator. Best of all - it's free!
<br>
<br>
<br>
In actuality, it's a web-based version of MS Office called Office Online. It will work regardless of whether your underlying OS is Linux, OS-X, or Windows. It includes Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, and Notes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
So if you want to use free web-based MS Office apps with your Linux system without Wine, heres how:
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Open your favorite web browser (I use Firefox for Linux).
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. You must first create a free Microsoft Account here: https://login.live.com  Click on the "Sign Up Now" option (lower right) to creat your account. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. After you've created your Microsoft account, go to Microsoft One Drive here: https://onedrive.live.com
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Next, click on the One Drive Sign In box at the top right. Use your Microsoft Account to sign in. You'll be re-directed to this link:  https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1394662346&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?cid=B0431E1C0159A4CF&resid=B0431E1C0159A4CF!164&app=Word&wdo=1&lc=1033&id=250206&cbcxt=sky&cbcxt=sky
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. After successfully signing in, you'll be redirected back to the MS One Drive Main page at https://onedrive.live.com
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. You are now in the One Drive environment, main page. In effect, you have created your own individual 7GB free cloud storage drive. Along with this comes access to MS Office On-Line.
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. To open to MS Office apps, there are two ways:
<br>
<br>
<br>
(a) At the top left next to the One Drive logo (with the cloud icon), click on the down arrow. This opens a list of links to apps - Outlook, Contacts, Calendar, One Drive (cloud storage) Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and OneNote.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(b) Or, at the top left next to the word Create, click the down arrow. You'll find options for going straight to creating Word docs, Excel spreadsheets, Powerpoint presentations, etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>
8. This tutorial does not cover specifics of how to use each MS Office application (perhaps a topic for a follow-on tutorial), other than the following points:
<br>
<br>
<br>
(a) In the One Drive main page, top left, you'll find Sort By. Click the down arrow to find options for sorting docs by name, type, date, etc. Hint - you have to create docs first for all sort options to be available.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(b) Next to Sort By you'll find icons for Views. Hovering your pointer over each icon shows options for Details View, Thumbnails View, or Details Pane. I prefer the Details View as it shows the folder structure of your One Drive account.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(c) You can create new docs on One Drive.  Use the Create button.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(d) You can upload existing docs to One Drive, and then edit in one of the MS Office apps.  Use the Upload button.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(e) You can save docs to One Drive, and/or save to your local system drive.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(f) In each app (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), at the top very far right of the screen, you'll see a question mark ?....this will open the useful Help Menu.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(g). Office on-line is meant to be highly collaborative (similar to Google Docs), so take a look at the collaboration features.
<br>
<br>
<br>
(h) There's no off-line MS Office capability, so if you want to work offline on a doc, you'll have to use your favorite Linux app (Libre, Open Office, text editor, etc)
